# CMPE_256-Fashion_Reccomendation_System
To develop a Fashion Embedding in this notebook, I will utilize a CNN Model. This data can be utilized to improve the semantic quality and similarity of Objects in machine learning techniques. We'll use embeddings to find objects that are similar, and RecSys will use that knowledge to suggest comparable stuff.
